# Troubleshooting 

## General Reboot 

In majority of cases, a general reboot of the Recharge Room will solve most technical problems. 

Steps for Rebooting:
1. **Unplug the WiFi router in the room and the connected Raspberry Pi device.** 
2. **Plug the router back in and wait a minute or two until the WiFi has reconnected.**
3.  **Once you have confirmed that you are receiving internet, connect the Raspberry Pi back to power as well.**

After a few minutes, try activating a scene with a voice command. 

::: tip
This reset is needed when things aren't connecting properly to each other and the internet, and it is the easiest way to reconnect all of the devices.

## General Scenarios



### Stuck on the Google Chromecast home screen    

Example:  

<img src="./images/home1.jpg" width="auto" height="320">  


If the projector is stuck on the Google Chromecast home screen, **click into the Youtube App** and say, **“Ok Google, activate menu.”**
  
You should see a black notification banner that says, **“Python”**, indicating that the room has reconnected. 


### Projector no signal detected

Example:  

<img src="./images/input1.jpg" width="auto" height="320">  

If the projector screen says **"No signal detected"** or **"Signal change detected"** this indicates that the Google Chromecast could be turned off. 

Use the projector remote controller and **click on the input source button**. Then, **click onto the source that the Chromecast is plugged into**, which is usually **HDMI 1**. 

If the error continues, make sure to **click the power button on the Chromecast remote**. This should take you back to the Chromecast homepage. From here, **click onto the Youtube app** and **try activating a scene with a voice command.** 

### Idle Youtube home screen
Example:  

<img src="./images/youtube1.jpg" width="auto" height="320">  

If you encounter the screen returning to an idle Youtube screensaver, simply say, **“Ok Google, activate menu.”** You should be reconnected to the Recharge Room.

### Google Chromecast stuck on loading wheel
This means that the Internet is out. **Try disconnecting and then reconnecting the router power.** Double-check that the WiFi is up, and if so, the Recharge Room should be reconnected.

### Google speaker is suddenly playing music 

If you find your Recharge Room suddenly playing music then this means someone has told the Google Assistant to do so. Simply say **“Ok Google, stop.”** and the room should be functioning as usual.
