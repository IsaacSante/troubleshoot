# Troubleshooting Recharge Room

## General reboot 

In majority of cases, a general reboot of the Recharge Room will solve most technical problems. 

To do this, unplug the WiFi router in the room and the Raspberry Pi device. Plug the router back in and wait a minute or two until the WiFi has reconnected. Once you have confirmed that you are receiving internet, connect the Raspberry Pi back to power as well.

After a few minutes, try activating some of the scenes with a voice command. 

::: tip
This reset is needed when things aren't connecting properly to each other and the internet, and it is the easiest way to reconnect all of the devices.

## General Scenarios



### Stuck on the Google Chromecast home screen    

Example:  

<img src="./images/home1.jpg" width="auto" height="320">  


If the projector is stuck on the Google Chromecast screen, click into the Youtube App and say, “Ok Google, Activate Menu.” 
  
You should see a black notification banner that says, “Python script reconnected”, indicating that the room has reconnected. 


### Projector no signal detected

Example:  

<img src="./images/input1.jpg" width="auto" height="320">  

If the projector screen says "No signal detected" or "Signal change detected" this indicates that the Google Chromecast could be turned off. 

Use the projector controller and click on the input source button. Click onto the source that the Chromecast is plugged into, which is usually HDMI 1. 

If the error continues, make sure to click the power button on the Chromecast remote. This should take you back to the Chromecast homepage. From here, click onto the Youtube app and try activating a scene with a voice command. 

### Idle Youtube home screen
Example:  

<img src="./images/youtube1.jpg" width="auto" height="320">  

If you encounter the screen returning to an idle Youtube screensaver, simply say, “Ok Google, Activate Menu.” You should be reconnected to the Recharge Room.

### Google Chromecast stuck on loading wheel
This means that the Internet is out. Try disconnecting and then reconnecting the router power. Double check that the WiFi is up, and if so, the Recharge Room should be reconnected.

### Google speaker is suddenly playing music 

If you find your recharge room suddenly playing music then this means someone has told the Google Assistant to do so. Simply say “Ok Google, stop” and the room should be functioning as usual.
