Studio Elsewhere’s Recharge Rooms are immersive biophilic private spaces that include music, scent, lighting, and sound, designed with research support from the Abilities Research Center at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai to address trauma, anxiety, and stress and improve cognitive performance.

You will then see a category with all of our available nature scenes. To activate any of these scenes, simply say **"Ok Google activate.."** followed by the name of the scene.


## Maintenance 



To make sure the room is working smoothly, have someone check come in and check on it at least twice throughout the week.  

**To check on the room:**
1. Activate the menu scene by saying "Ok Google, activate menu."
1. Try two other scenes available to ensure the system is working correctly

::: tip
This verifies that the room is connected, as devices can become disconnected if left inactive for too long.
